What is Generative AI?
Generative AI is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that doesn’t just think — it can create new things! This means it can generate things like text, pictures, videos, and music.

Features of Generative AI:
Creativity: Generative AI uses the knowledge it has learned to make new things. For example, if you say “I want a story,” it will create a brand-new story just for you.

Learning from Data: It has looked at millions of examples. If you want a picture, it uses everything it has learned from other pictures to create a new one.

Custom Creations: You can tell it exactly what you want, and it will create something special. For example, you can say, “Make a video of a dancing robot,” and it will create something new and unique.

Examples of Generative AI:
ChatGPT: This is an example of Generative AI. When you ask a question, it creates a new answer using its knowledge.

DALL·E: Another example — it can create images. If you say, “A monkey playing guitar,” it can draw a brand-new image like that.

How Does Generative AI Work?
Generative AI learns from training data, which includes:

Pictures (photos, drawings)

Text (books, blogs, articles)

Sounds (music, voice clips)

When you ask for something, it remembers what it has learned and creates something new based on that. Every time, it combines ideas in a fresh way to make a unique result.
